/*
JavaScript  : 
              Synchronous : one by one execution
              Single Threda : JS Engine is slower and single threaded but 
                            never lets you feel the slow ness as they are coupled with
                            Node or browser Run Time.
Execution Context
    :=> Execute one line of code at a time 
    console.log() -> 1
    console.log() -> 2 

    CallStack  MemoryHeap

    //each operaion waits for the last one to complete before executing


            
Blocking Code(Does block execution) Vs Non Blocking Code (Does not block execution)
eg. Read File Sync                      eg. Read File Async

File reading goes to kernel and then again control comes to program.
But Kernel is very busy and says wait until i am free.


JS Engine has MemoryHeap and Call CallStack
but JS Engine have with Node and Browser Run time Environment

Call Stack calls from Web API (Browser) : 
                DOM API, Set Timeout, Set Interval : Register Call back :They have Task Queue
                and  Fetch(Promise) : High Priority Queue

Event Loop is for TaskQueoue (is why the JS is fast).

Program is loaded in Memory and then call stack is prepared.
Then one by one function load hote hai... and unload hote hai khtm hone pe.

eg. 1, [0sec,2], 3
o/p is 1-> 3-> 2 this the Queue.
